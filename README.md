An idea I had...
================

This program is meant to be a solution to something that has been bothering me
whilst I was developing [BreakHack](https://github.com/liquidityc/breakhack).

I'm to lazy to go into detail now, the idea is to make it simpler to check out
what coordinates a sprite has in a sprite sheet in a simple way that would better
suit my way of working.

I'll get more of it done once I get the time...
